# Cloud Infrastructure Automation

A comprehensive AWS CloudFormation solution for deploying secure, highly available web applications with enterprise-grade security controls and automated infrastructure management.

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced infrastructure-as-code practices through AWS CloudFormation, implementing a robust cloud architecture with emphasis on security, high availability, and automated deployment.

## Architecture Features

### Security Controls
- Private subnet isolation for application layers
- NAT gateways for secure outbound traffic
- Bastion hosts for secure administrative access
- Network ACLs and security groups
- IAM roles implementing principle of least privilege

### High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployment architecture
- Auto-scaling configurations
- Load balancer distribution
- Fault-tolerant design

### Infrastructure as Code
- Automated CloudFormation deployments
- Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
- Parameterized templates for flexibility
- Standardized deployment processes
